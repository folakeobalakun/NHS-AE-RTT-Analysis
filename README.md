# NHS-AE-RTT-Analysis
Interactive Powerâ€¯BI dashboard tracking NHS A&amp;E 4â€‘hour performance and 52â€‘week RTT backlogs.

*Powerâ€¯BI report blending monthly A&E SitRep data with RTT waitingâ€‘time returns to track national and trustâ€‘level operational pressure.*

##Â Project Purpose
Elective backlogs and emergencyâ€‘department crowding are two of the most visible NHS performance issues.  
This dashboard lets managers, analysts, and clinicians **see both problems in one place**, filtering by month and region down to individual trusts.

## Key KPIs

| KPI | Definition (DAX) | Why it matters |
|-----|------------------|----------------|
| **4â€‘Hour A&E Performance %** | `SUM(SeenWithin4h) / SUM(TotalAttends)` | NHS constitutional standard is **95â€¯%** |
| **â‰¥52â€‘Week RTT Backlog %** | `SUM(Wait_52w) / SUM(Wait_Total)` | Elective waits over a year are a prime backlog metric |
| **A&E Attendances** | `SUM(TotalAttends)` | Proxy for unplanned demand |
| **Patients â‰¥52â€¯w** | `SUM(Wait_52w)` | Absolute backlog burden |

## ðŸŒŸÂ Headline Findings
* **National recovery**: Fourâ€‘hour performance improved **+4â€¯pp** from its December low; â‰¥â€¯52â€‘week backlog shrank by **1.5â€¯pp** over the year.  
* **Persistent hotspots**: 12 trusts remain above the **4â€¯% backlog risk** threshold despite national improvement.  
* **Demandâ€‘risk correlation**: High attendances donâ€™t always equal high backlogâ€”Northâ€‘East hospitals manage demand well, while several Southâ€‘East independents carry disproportionate backlog.
